She despised her skin – how it looked in comparison to the other girls she saw in the media. Her skin wasn’t as healthy as she wished, her pores were much bigger than she wanted, her texture and tone wasn’t even, and her complexion was dull and problematic.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Over a course of 10 years, she tried every serum, cleanser, mask, skin treatment, and vitamin to get the healthy, glowing skin she yearned for. Yet, after each treatment she invested money and time in, she kept ending up disappointed.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>On the brink of giving up, she did more research on edible beauty (aka, cosmeceuticals) and it was then that she began adding collagen to her smoothies and drinks in hopes of improving her skin. Within 2 months, her dull complexion and big pores were replaced with tight, healthy, glowing skin. Her hair also stopped falling out, nails stopped breaking, and within that same year, she didn’t get sick once – something that has never happened in her life. She couldn’t believe a simple addition like this changed her life but after seeing benefits firsthand, she turned to a collagen convert.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076592858" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076592858"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><b>Breaking Down the Facts</b></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076629332" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076629332"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><br></p><p>The science is clear: collagen is the most abundant source of protein in our bodies; it’s a major structural protein that our bodies naturally produce and is essential to the functioning of our connective tissue. In fact, collagen makes up 30% of the total protein in our bodies, 70% of our hair, 80% of our skin, and 90% of our bone mass. Yeah, it’s pretty vital to the health of our appearance and wellbeing.</p><p><br></p><p>Think of collagen as the glue that holds our bodies together – our bodies depend on it to keep skin plump, hair healthy, joints robust, muscles strong, and our digestive system working properly.</p><p><br></p><p>But with any trend, staying informed is essential to making it worth trying. We love a good fad as much as the next, but education is essential.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Here are a few myth busting tips to help you stay weary of collagen trends out there.</p><p><br></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076655400" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076655400"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><b>1. “I Heard Collagen Doesn’t Even Work?”&nbsp;</b></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076680215" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076680215"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><br></p><p>You heard wrong. The truth is, collagen has actually been around for centuries. It’s an ancient tradition used by Asiatic regions through consuming collagen-rich dishes, such as chicken feet and beef tendons, for its incredible (and now not so secret) health and beauty benefits – long before trends were getting started.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>You may have seen many sources claiming collagen doesn’t do anything and is just a myth. We’re here to put this myth to rest – for good.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>While collagen has been around for ages, clinical studies have more recently come to light due to the spike in traction. With the recency of collagen’s popularity, the number of clinical trials are increasing but are not as great in comparison to alternative means out there – resulting in individuals reporting back with distrust and discredibility.</p><p><br></p><p>However, thanks to science, clinical trials have proven collagen’s awe inspiring, glow worthy results. Consuming collagen enhances fibroblast synthesis for positive benefits on your skin and health. We’ll cover that shortly.</p><p><br></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076749892" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076749892"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><b>2. “My Body Already Produces Collagen, So Why Would I Need More?”&nbsp;</b></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076941630" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076941630"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><br></p><p>You’re halfway there.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>While collagen might be perfect in every other way, we all have our faults – and collagen is partial when it comes to age.</p><p><br></p><p>Starting in our 20’s, our bodies produce less collagen at a declining rate of 1.5% per year. Meaning, the older you get, the less collagen your body produces – with results showing a 30% lack of collagen by our 40’s. What does this mean? The best time to start taking collagen is now.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>With this decline in collagen, our cells lose structure and become weaker, thinner, and looser, leading to things like wrinkles, dull/dehydrated skin, frail hair, breaking nails, joint pain, weaker digestion and immune system, less energy, and aching bones and muscles.</p><p><br></p><p>But hope isn’t all lost. Science shows that by consuming collagen through supplementation, we can regenerate, restore, and strengthen our connective tissue, resulting in benefits for our entire body – inside and out.</p><p><br></p><p>One study evaluated the effects of ingesting collagen and found that through consistent intake over 8 weeks, collagen, indeed, has the ability to improve skin’s elasticity and hydration while reducing wrinkles.</p><p><br></p><p>Another study reviewed 11 studies with a total of 805 patients, found that collagen ingestion for 8-24 weeks resulted in significant improvement in skin aging, skin elasticity, and hydration. The study also concluded that long-term consumption of collagen can aid with wound healing and skin aging.</p><p><br></p><p>While the results may be few (if you consider hundreds of clinical trials to be few), they’re real and prove the efficacy of collagen. We could list more results of clinical studies, but we’ll save you the time so you can begin your collagen regimen – you can also read more up on the breakdown of collagen here.</p><p><br></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076748644" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076748644"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><b>3. “Supplementing Collagen?

Scientifically, collagen found in topical products actually can’t be absorbed through your epidermis (skin’s outermost layer) since the particles are too large to reach the dermis (where your skin’s collagen is located). For those of you who have seen improvement in your skin from using topicals that contain collagen, it’s probably the effects from other ingredients in that product.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So, does drinking collagen work? When you consume collagen, it’s absorbed by your body and goes through the small intestine and transported through various parts of the body through your bloodstream. Studies show ingesting collagen benefits your appearance but you have no control of where the collagen you consume actually goes. This just means that collagen side effects – or, rather, benefits from consuming collagen – vary from person to person. But that’s true with just about anything because we’re all different, each and every one of us.</p><p><br></p><p>In short: You need to consume collagen in order to reap the benefits that collagen provides. Even if you’re not trying to get youthful skin or stronger hair, your body needs the amino acids found in collagen to keep your body functioning smoothly and properly.</p><p><br></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606076748120" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606076748120"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><b>4. “I Have to Take a Certain Type of Collagen in Order to Get the Benefits”</b></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" id="e-1606077061494" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1606077061494"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><br></p><p>While there are different ways to consume collagen, there are also different types to consume. But, don’t give up just yet – We did our research, so you don’t have to.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>There isn’t one type of collagen, but 28 different types that can be found in our bodies. For your information (and those collagen product reviews you keep reading about), types I, II, and III make up the vast majority of collagen in our bodies with over 90% equalling in type I.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Truth be told, you can’t go wrong with taking any type of collagen. All types of collagen will benefit your overall health and appearance because collagen is made up of amino acids that are responsible for increasing fibroblast elastin synthesis for positive effects on your skin, hair, nails, and overall health.</p><p><br></p><p>All that to say, if you’re interested in targeting particular areas or improving your health and beauty overall, just know you should be taking types I, II, and/or III.
