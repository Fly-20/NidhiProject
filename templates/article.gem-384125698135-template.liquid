<p class="">We live in an era where our self-image is constantly bombarded by social media, peers, and the biggest critic of all time - our own selves. We’re continuously searching for the next best thing - products, jobs, people. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, in fact, it can be a great thing when it comes to trying to be better and do better. However, it changes when it constitutes our perception of who we <em>think </em>we should be like and how we<em> </em>should look.</p>
<p class="">Can you remember when was the last time you looked in the mirror without critiquing yourself - not one bit? But instead, were actually gratified for who you are and how you look?</p>
<p class="">For me, it was this specific day when I stood in front of the mirror and was fed up with finding fault every time I looked at myself. It was this day when I told myself it was time to overcome the barriers that have always urged me not to accept me for who I was and how I looked.</p>
<h3><strong><br>GENETICS</strong></h3>
<p class="">I wasn’t born with blemish-free skin, small pores, or thick hair. Rather, I grew up with extremely noticeable skin issues and always covered my face with makeup whenever I left the house. Even when my skin cleared up, I continued to wear makeup every time I stepped outside whether that was to go to the grocery store, get the mail, or even answer the door<em>. </em>So, the notion of having to cover my face in order to feel accepted not just by others, but by myself was overwhelming and somewhat outrageous. I became fed up with hiding my true self for the purpose of feeling comfortable.</p>
<p class="">The day I decided enough was enough and that it was time for some real self-love and acceptance, was the day I set my mind to actually do something about it. That said, I’ve always taken care of my skin - have a regimen, never wear makeup to bed, eat a balanced diet, drink plenty of water, get 7-8 hours of sleep. However, the feeling of self-doubt stemmed from me not being happy with my skin, or to say the least, my skin <em>type</em>. Genetics granted me the honor of oily skin and larger pores (woohoo!), which was something that caused me to be unhappy with my skin's appearance.</p>
<p class="">Thus, I set forth and tried countless facials, serums, creams, masks, vitamins - you name it. And while some proved to be effective, none gave me the results I was looking for - the type that didn’t fade after a few hours, but rather, made me feel comfortable to walk outside with a bare face.</p>
<p class="">In terms of having fine hair, this led to me being continually self-conscious about my thin eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair which, was prone to falling out on a daily basis. The products I used in an attempt to improve my skin were also supposed to help with my hair, but nothing quite did the trick.</p>
<h3><strong><br>DISCOVERY</strong></h3>
<p class="">I stayed content, but not satisfied, until I did more research and found something that finally worked for me, something that was <em>enough</em> for me: collagen. I started ingesting (drinking) collagen every day which, was when my inner beauty journey began. At first, I was skeptical about whether it would work or if it was just a fad. Regardless of this dubious feeling, I stuck with it for a few months by experimenting and creating my own concoctions at home that were collagen based with other ingredients like biotin and horsetail, and just like that, I actually started to see a difference in my complexion.</p>
<h3><strong><br>SKIN AND HAIR</strong></h3>
<meta content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type"><meta content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="BEFORE (UNEDITED)" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Beforeaftercollagenphoto1_large.jpg?v=1588035583" style="float: none;"><br>BEFORE (UNEDITED)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="AFTER 2 MONTHS (UNEDITED)" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Beforeaftercollagenphoto2_large.jpg?v=1588035616" style="float: none;"><br>AFTER 2 MONTHS (UNEDITED)</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p class="">The two photos above are of me wearing makeup before and after I started consuming my collagen based blends. My skin texture smoothed out, skin brightened up, and complexion began to look naturally dewy (on a side note, my hair looked shinier, healthier, and more hydrated). I know I should have a photo with no makeup before taking collagen to compare, but I <em>never</em> stepped outside the house without makeup, let alone take photos without it. Nonetheless, after seeing these photos I didn’t realize how dull my skin looked before or that it <em>can</em> improve overall.</p>
<p class="">It was then when I actually started to feel comfortable leaving the house without the slightest bit of makeup on. Now, I’m not claiming collagen perfected my skin as that’s simply not the case. In fact, there are even days when the results aren’t as prominent as others and I still have bad skin days because that’s merely human nature, and hormones. Rather, I saw a difference in my complexion and was finally happy in my own skin, something that seemed far from reach. As for my skin type, I accepted that I wasn’t born with small pores or a normal (well-balanced) skin type. I can never change my skin type, but began to appreciate who I was, how I looked, and what it meant to become the best that I can be, for no one other than myself.</p>
<p class="">As mentioned, I wasn’t born with thick hair, but rather with thin, fine, and quite frankly feeble hair. Growing up, I tried numerous products in an attempt to grow my hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows to be thicker and fuller, but nothing really helped.</p>
<p class="" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="BEFORE (UNEDITED)" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Beforeaftercollagenhair1_large.jpg?v=1588035717" style="float: none;"><br>BEFORE (UNEDITED)</p>
<p class="" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="AFTER 7 MONTHS (UNEDITED)" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Beforeaftercollagenhair2_large.jpg?v=1588035771" style="float: none;"><br>AFTER 7 MONTHS (UNEDITED)</p>
<p class="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/wholydosebeforeaftereyebrows2_large.jpg?v=1588035806" alt="AFTER 1.5 YEARS (UNEDITED)"><br>AFTER 1.5 YEARS (UNEDITED)</p>
<p class="">Fast forward a few years later, collagen helped my hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows grow thicker - my eyebrows looked more filled due to this which, I no longer need to fill them in all the way. My hair stopped falling out as much and for once, I could use an eyelash curler without worrying my eyelashes will instantly break. That said, I understood and accepted that I would never and will never have bushy eyebrows, doll-like eyelashes, or coarse hair because that isn’t realistic for me due to, once again, genetics - I was totally okay with that and continued to progress the best I can.</p>
<p class="">Additionally, my nails stopped breaking, which used to occur almost every day. This was major because I became fed up with having broken nails regularly, which is no fun and definitely ruins a manicure!</p>
<h3><strong><br>SCARS AND WOUNDS</strong></h3>
<p class="">After starting my inner beauty journey, I experienced first hand that collagen helps heal scars and wounds. The photo on the bottom left is of a scar I got from a burn, which lessened in appearance drastically after just 2 weeks.</p>
<meta content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="BEFORE (UNEDITED)" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Beforeaftercollagen_burnscar1_large.jpg?v=1588035904" style="float: none;"><br>BEFORE (UNEDITED)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="AFTER 2 WEEKS (UNEDITED)" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Beforeaftercollagen_burnscar2_large.jpg?v=1588035938" style="float: none;"><br>AFTER 2 WEEKS (UNEDITED)</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>This was especially surprising because this scar was originally the same size of another scar I got years ago, but the difference is that this scar healed </span><em>completely</em><span> after 4 weeks of consuming collagen whereas the scar I got from before never went away. </span></p>
<meta content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="SCAR ON LEFT STAYED FOREVER | SCAR ON RIGHT AFTER 2 WEEKS" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Beforeaftercollagen_burnscar3_large.jpg?v=1588036133" style="float: none;"><br>SCAR ON LEFT STAYED FOREVER | SCAR ON RIGHT AFTER 2 WEEKS</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p class="">As you can see in the photo above, the scar I got years ago stayed forever (on arm) compared to the scar I got while taking collagen (on hand), which previously mentioned, used to be the same size as the other scar and has now completely disappeared!</p>
<h3><strong><br>OVERALL HEALTH</strong></h3>
<p class="">In terms of health, my digestion improved significantly where I stopped getting stomach aches regularly and I no longer felt fatigued throughout the day (collagen contains the amino acid glycine, which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26882/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been found to boost energy levels</a>). My immune system strengthened greatly and I didn’t get sick in over a year, which is a big deal considering I’ve always gotten sick at least 2-3 times per year. I stopped craving sweets on a daily basis (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19185957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collagen helps curb cravings</a> due to it being low in fat, high in protein) - I used to get cravings almost every day!</p>
<p class="">On top of that, my mood improved and general frame of mind evolved to be more positive, which, in turn, made me happier overall (the amino acid found in collagen, glycine, has also been found to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23615880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support gut health</a>, which can help <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-9-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve overall health and mood</a>).</p>
<h3>
<br><strong>REAL SELF-LOVE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="">My collagen journey indeed helped me achieve self-love, but I understood collagen wasn’t a cure-all because it’s not. Instead, it bridged the way for me to find something that finally worked for me, which is when I started to truly practice self-love by appreciating who I was and how I look. This, in turn, made me feel good and genuinely happy about myself - something that was rarely the case. I no longer compared myself with others nor did I complain about things I can’t change - like my skin or hair - but, rather, embraced it all.</p>
<p class="">At the end of the day, it’s far more important to feel good about ourselves and accept ourselves for who we are - even the aspects we don’t love. Getting there can be harder than it should be, but taking that first step will open oh, so many doors to a better you, the best version, for no one other than yourself. As for me, my collagen journey helped me to focus on self-love and health, inside and out.</p>
