<p class="">Collagen seems to be everywhere nowadays and has turned into a phenomenon that many people are embracing. From lotions to supplements, and now even bath salts - it seems as though collagen is on everything and is everywhere. But, what is collagen, exactly? How does collagen work and what does it actually do?<br><br></p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS COLLAGEN?</strong></h3>
<p class="">Whether you’ve heard about collagen or not, collagen is inside your body and everyone’s bodies and will continue to stay there. Collagen is a major structural protein that our bodies naturally produce - it is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most abundant</a> source of protein in our bodies. This means that collagen is essential to the functioning of our connective tissue and gives structure to our skin, hair, nails, joints, muscles, and bones. In fact, collagen makes up <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30% of the </a><a href="http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>total </em>protein</a> in our bodies, <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80% of our skin</a>, hair, muscles, joints, and <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90% of our bone mass</a>. In other words, it’s pretty important. </p>
<p class="">Think of collagen as the glue that <a href="http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holds your body together</a>. Our bodies depend on collagen to keep our skin hydrated and plump, hair healthy, joints robust, muscles strong, and digestive system working properly. </p>
<p class="">Up until recently, mainstream usage of collagen has been predominantly known as lotions, topicals, and injections - this has misguidedly led people to perceive collagen as something to apply on the skin instead of something to consume. Because collagen is produced <em>inside</em> the body, products containing collagen such as lotions and topicals <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cosmetic-Dermatology-Principles-Leslie-Baumann/dp/0071362819?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201719262&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t have the same effects</a> as consuming it - more below.<br><br></p>
<h3><strong>WHY IS COLLAGEN IMPORTANT?</strong></h3>
<p class="">Collagen is vital to the health and appearance of our skin, hair, nails, joints, muscles, and bones. However, our bodies produce less and less collagen starting in our 20’s, at a decreasing rate of <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.5% per year</a>. By our mid-late 40’s, our bodies lose up to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4938278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30% of collagen</a>. With this decline in collagen, our cells lose their structure and become weaker, thinner, and looser, leading to signs of aging. So, the aging skin, brittle hair, creaking joints, and digestive issues aren’t necessarily only a factor of age. They’re actually symptoms of diminished collagen levels.</p>
<p class="">Nonetheless, science <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shows</a> that by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30681787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consuming collagen</a>, we can regenerate, restore, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17076983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strengthen</a> our connective tissue, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30681787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resulting</a> in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29949889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefits</a> for the entire body - <a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/effects-of-collagen-ingestion-and-their-biological-significance-2155-9600-1000504.php?aid=73603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inside and outside.</a> Before we jump into the benefits of taking collagen, let’s start by explaining how collagen actually works. </p>
<h3><strong><br>HOW DOES COLLAGEN WORK?</strong></h3>
<p class="">As mentioned before, collagen occurs in many places throughout the body and can be seen as the glue that holds our bodies together. It’s what gives our bodies structure and support in areas like our skin, hair, muscles, joints, bones, and nails.</p>
<p class=""><br><img alt="COLLAGEN TRIPLE HELIX - PHOTO BY PDB-101" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/3670/4087/files/Collagentriplehelix_howdoescollagenwork_large.png?v=1588035339" style="float: left;">Now, back to amino acids. Why are amino acids important? What are amino acids, exactly? Collagen is made up of a protein called amino acids, which are long chains linked together in a tight <a href="https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/4" target="_blank" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1587963001822_709" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple helix</a> shape. By way of illustration, let’s call it a collagen triple helix. Now, think of this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15837519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collagen triple helix</a> like rope - rope is made up of fibers that are bonded tightly together. When a rope starts to get loose, it loses its shape and instead, turns into a bunch of loose fibers. Collagen is very similar to this because collagen is a fibrous protein that is tightly bonded together and gets looser and stretchier as we age. </p>
<p class="">Amino acids are crucial <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building blocks of protein</a>. The human body is made up of <a href="https://knowscience.org/blog/what-are-we-made-of-the-role-of-proteins-in-our-body-and-in-our-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20% protein</a> in which, amino acids are the building blocks of it. Protein plays a vital role in almost all bodily functions and is necessary for the structure of our bodies. </p>
<p class="">There are <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/pages/factsheet_structuralbiology.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 different amino acids</a> our bodies need in order to function properly and support our cells and connective tissue. 11 out of the 20 amino acids can be produced by our bodies - these are called nonessential amino acids. The other 9 must be consumed since our bodies cannot produce them - these are essential amino acids.</p>
<p class="">Now, don’t let the terms throw you off because all 20 amino acids, both essential and nonessential, are as equally crucial to the functions of our bodies. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonessential amino acids</a> can sound slightly misleading, because they actually do have essential roles in the body, but since they’re produced by our bodies, they’re not essential to our diets. We can still get nonessential amino acids through diet, but the difference is that we don’t need to worry about getting enough of these amino acids since our bodies will make up for any gaps. </p>
<p class="">Amino acids <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found in collagen</a> carry specific nutrients that play a vital role in the elasticity of our skin, health of our hair and nails, strength of our joints, muscles, and bones, role in fat metabolism, and health of our immune and digestive system.</p>
<p class="">Let’s take a deeper look. </p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">As you can see from the photo above, our skin has <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 layers</a>: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The outer layer of the epidermis is referred to as the cuticle, which is the layer of skin that is visible. As we age, this outer layer of skin becomes saggier, weaker, and rougher. As shown above, collagen (which is <a href="https://www.cell.com/imto/pdf/0167-5699(86)90067-8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">produced</a> by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/fibroblast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fibroblasts</a>) and elastin fibers become weaker and less plentiful <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with age</a>, resulting in wrinkly and stretchier skin. For that reason, signs of aging such as wrinkles, brittle hair, frail joints, and weak muscles aren’t necessarily by virtue of age, but rather, diminished collagen levels. </p>
<p class="">As previously mentioned, topical products containing collagen simply don’t have the same effects as consuming collagen because it doesn’t stimulate collagen production. As you can see from the photo above, collagen fibers are located in the <a href="http://lesliebaumannmd.com/understanding-the-skin-and-its-components/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dermis layer</a> of the skin - topically applying collagen can’t penetrate through the skin into the dermis layer because <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cosmetic-Dermatology-Principles-Leslie-Baumann/dp/0071362819?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201719262&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collagen molecules</a> are too large to fit through the outermost layer of the skin.<br><br></p>
<h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF TAKING COLLAGEN?</strong></h3>
<p class=""><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/0471238961.0705120111050514.a01.pub2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collagen contains</a> 18 out of the 20 amino acids needed for our bodies to function properly - yep, you heard that right, 18. So, it only makes sense that taking collagen is followed by an array of health and beauty benefits. Let’s take a look at them.</p>
<h3><span>SKIN</span></h3>
<p class="">As you now know, about 80% of our skin is made of collagen. Collagen helps <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replenish connective tissue</a> which, in turn, restores the skin and strengthens its cells. As seen in the photo above, this restoring process occurs in the dermis layer of the skin. Our body uses collagen to hold up skin cells, which helps tighten and smooth out the outer layer of skin while <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improving elasticity</a>. With this strengthening of cells, our skin can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lock in moisture</a> better - <a href="http://www.jmnn.org/article.asp?issn=2278-1870;year=2015;volume=4;issue=1;spage=47;epage=53;aulast=Borumand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keeping it hydrated</a>, plump, and youthful looking.</p>
<p class="">Collagen <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helps repair</a> and replace damaged skin tissue by <a href="https://www.hairloss-research.org/UpdateBioavailableCollagen-KeratinSupplementReversesAgeRelatedHairlossSkinLaxity7-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating new cells</a>. Studies show that when taken consistently, collagen can have <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONUTRAJ/TONUTRAJ-8-29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positive benefits</a> on the skin.</p>

</ul>
<h3><span>HAIR</span></h3>
<p class="">Like skin, hair undergoes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15726300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chronological aging</a>. Hair is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4201279/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily made up</a> of a protein called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079642515000596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keratin</a> where our bodies use amino acids to <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.560.4793&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build it</a> - some, of which are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4201279/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> in collagen <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123210000573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as arginine</a>. By consuming amino acids found in collagen, we can increase hair follicle regeneration <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Amino-Revolution-Robert-Erdmann/9780671673598" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">through abundant protein intake</a> and build more keratin needed for stronger, healthier, more hydrated hair. </p>
<p class="">Collagen makes up roughly <a href="https://www.derm101.com/inflammatory/embryologic-histologic-and-anatomic-aspects/collagen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70% of the dermis</a> layer of our skin, which is the same layer where the root of each hair follicle is located. So, when our bodies have <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/02/05/national/science-health/age-linked-hair-loss-caused-disappearing-collagen-researchers-say/#.XP1DkNNKgWp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abundant levels</a> of collagen, we can maintain a healthy dermis and may prevent hair thinning and hair loss, while <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25989472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strengthening hair follicles</a>.</p>
<p class="">In addition to aging, research shows that <a href="https://www.livescience.com/54901-free-radicals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free radicals</a> (compounds created in our bodies as a result of stress, pollution, poor diet, smoking, or alcohol) can damage hair follicles. Having <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26574302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many free radicals</a> in our bodies can harm our cells, proteins, and DNA. Our bodies’ defense against free radicals declines with age and the older we get, the more we are susceptive to hair damage. That said, antioxidants help the body fight free radicals to promote healthy hair. Studies show that collagen has antioxidant properties and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3853751/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can fight free radicals</a> - hence, supporting <a href="https://www.hairloss-research.org/UpdateBioavailableCollagen-KeratinSupplementReversesAgeRelatedHairlossSkinLaxity7-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthy hair</a>.</p>

<h3><span>NAILS</span></h3>
<p class="">Much like hair and skin, our nails <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7142618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">undergo changes</a> as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15726300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we age</a>. These <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changes include</a> a decline in growth rate, increase in brittleness, possible discoloration, and weaker, thinner nails. Arginine, one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most crucial</a> amino acids for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123210000573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nail growth</a>, is <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/ra/c7ra02842c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found in collagen</a>. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28786550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies</a> have found that collagen helps increase nail growth, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16205932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce the brittleness</a> of nails, and decrease the frequency of nails breaking.</p>

<h3><span>JOINTS AND BONES</span></h3>
<p class="">Have you ever felt stiffness or pain when you move? Yup, that’s likely due to loss of collagen. When it comes to our joints and bones, collagen is a vital protein that keeps them strong and healthy. Studies have found that collagen <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18416885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduces joint pain</a> and the risk of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29337906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint deterioration</a>. Think of ingesting collagen like lubricating a creaky door hinge. Collagen helps lubricate our joints and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16341622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bones</a> to help them work properly and smoothly. It helps <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071580" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hold our bones</a> together to make our joints move more easily. </p>

<h3><span>MUSCLES</span></h3>
<p class="">Collagen is a major component of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/connective-tissue/Extracellular-fibres#ref470867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">muscle tissue</a>. Science has identified that our bodies’ process for healing torn or ruptured muscles is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regeneration of muscle fibers</a> with the production of connective scar tissue. Collagen aids with this process, since collagen helps restore connective tissue throughout the body. Roughly <a href="http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-third of protein</a> found in collagen is glycine - this amino acid helps form <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15465806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creatine</a>, which promotes healthy muscle growth. Additionally, studies show that consuming collagen helps <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594048/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase lean muscle mass</a> and can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26353786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase muscle strength</a>, especially when working out. </p>

<p class="">Collagen contains the amino acid, glycine, which is known to form muscle tissue by converting glucose <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/glycine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into energy</a> to feed muscle cells - this can help <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/61/5/1058/4781908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boost metabolism</a> and energy levels. As previously mentioned, collagen can help increase lean muscle mass which, in turn, can give your metabolism a boost because <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">muscle burns more calories</a> than fat.</p>

<h3><span>DIGESTION &amp; GUT HEALTH</span></h3>
<p class="">Consuming collagen helps <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206255/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heal the lining</a> of our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3792777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gastrointestinal tract</a> (GI tract), aka our digestive system and gut. This is important because science shows that our gut health is linked to our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20656465?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overall health</a> and well-being, and that many <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diseases and health issues</a> can be<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3983973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> traced back to poor gut health</a>. Moreover, our gut <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369670/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plays a vital role</a> in a number of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Glutamine, an amino acid found in collagen, has been found to restore bowel functioning. <a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/good-food/health-benefits-of-collagen/slide/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Dr. <a href="http://www.drnicoleavena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Avena</a>, collagen is a hydrophilic molecule (has an attraction to water and acidic molecules) and ingesting it improves our digestion and can help food move through our GI tract more smoothly - this can help to regulate bowel movements.</p>
<p class="">As we age, we are more prone to a <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/leaky-gut-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you-2017092212451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaky gut</a> (intestinal permeability), which is a condition where bacteria toxins and acids <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“leak” through</a> our digestive tract. This may lead to bloating, low energy, fatigue, brain fog, weight gain, headaches, joint pain, food sensitivities, low metabolism, digestive problems, and skin issues such as acne, eczema, or rosacea. Glutamine has also been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369670/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proven to prevent</a> inflammation and help heal a leaky gut. </p>
<p class="">That said, collagen helps support a healthy digestive system and lines our GI tract, which, in turn, can help boost overall health.</p>

</ul>
<h3><span>IMMUNITY &amp; OVERALL HEALTH</span></h3>
<p class="">As mentioned, our overall health has a lot to do with our gut. Since consuming collagen helps line our gastrointestinal tract, this, in turn, can help boost our immune system. A healthy gut translates to a healthy immune system.</p>
<h3><span>APPETITE AND WEIGHT</span></h3>
<p class="">One of the main reasons why we consume protein is to help keep our bodies full and nourished. Collagen does just this since, it is low in fat and high in protein, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19185957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keeping us full and satisfied</a>. This, in turn, helps to reduce cravings. Studies have found that taking collagen <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18319637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increases the satiety hormone</a>, which helps control hunger and curb cravings that contain ingredients such as salt, sugar, oil, or fatty foods. People <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19185957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also reported</a> that consuming collagen keeps them more full and satisfied than other protein supplements such as whey or soy. </p>

<h3><span>SLEEP QUALITY</span></h3>
<p class="">Collagen is known to improve overall sleep quality due to glycine, an abundant amino acid found in collagen that has been linked to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2014326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">affecting neurotransmitters</a> in <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/118/2/118_11R04FM/_pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promoting better sleep quality</a>.<br><br></p>
<h3><strong>TYPES OF COLLAGEN - WHICH SHOULD I TAKE?</strong></h3>
<p class="">By now, you’ve probably heard of the different types of collagen - type I, type II, type III, and so on. Indeed, there are at least <a href="https://www.japsonline.com/admin/php/uploads/1466_pdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">28 different types</a> of collagen found in our bodies. Types I, II, and III make up the vast majority of collagen in our bodies and over 90% is type I. So, which should you take?</p>
<p class="">Truth be told, all types of collagen will benefit your overall health and appearance - skin, hair, joints, muscles, bones, nails, and so forth. This is primarily because all types of collagen are made up of beneficial amino acids responsible for maintaining and supporting connective tissues and cells. That said, if you’re interested in targeting particular areas, just know that types I, II, and III are the most prevalent. </p>
<p class="">Type I collagen: the most dominant in the body; highly recommended for skin, hair, nails, bones, organs, tendons, joints, ligaments, tissue, and the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and digestion) - in other words, type I collagen is well rounded.</p>
<p class="">Type II collagen: primarily found in the cartilage; recommended for joint pain or arthritis symptoms. </p>
<p class="">Type III collagen: highly suggested for skin, organs, blood vessels, tissue, and bones - it is usually found alongside with type I collagen. <br><br></p>
<h3><strong>WHERE DOES COLLAGEN COME FROM?</strong></h3>
<p class="">Collagen is inherently <a href="https://www.japsonline.com/admin/php/uploads/1466_pdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animal derived</a>. The most prevalent types of collagen include: </p>
<p class="">Marine collagen</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Sourced from fish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Contains type I collagen</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="">Bovine collagen</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Sourced from cattle/cow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Contains types I and III collagen</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="">Chicken collagen </p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Sourced from poultry/chicken </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Contains type II collagen</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="">Other types of collagen can be sourced from pig, egg shells, or other animals. <br><br></p>
<h3><strong>HOW DID COLLAGEN COME ABOUT? </strong></h3>
<p class="">For those who aren’t aware, collagen has been around for ages, really. People have been consuming collagen for centuries.</p>
<p class="">You may be thinking you eat animal sourced protein daily and might not need collagen. However, collagen isn’t found in steak, chicken drumsticks, or fish fillets - rather, in the bones, skin, tissues, and joints of animals. That said, most people don’t typically eat these parts of animals, but there are those who do and have been for a very long time - this is especially true of Asiatic regions where chicken feet, tripe (stomach lining), and blood pudding are staples. Now, that might not sound too tasty to you, but these dishes are considered cultural delicacies in these regions, to this day.</p>
<p class="">There’s another form of collagen that has been around since the Paleo period — bone broth. Now, you may also be thinking you consume plenty of soups, but stock is <em>not</em> the same as bone broth because stock is simmered for a much less amount of time than broth, which is simmered for a minimum of 12-20 hours to get all the nutrients and benefits. </p>
<p class="">So, what if you don’t want to eat these parts of animals or don’t have time to simmer bone broth for hours, or days? Good news, there are simpler and more universally palatable ways to do so.</p>
<h3><strong><br>HOW TO TAKE COLLAGEN</strong></h3>
<p class="">Collagen can be consumed in a variety of ways. See below.</p>
<p class=""><span>COLLAGEN POWDER</span></p>
<p class="">Collagen powder - also referred to as collagen peptides, collagen hydrolysate, or hydrolyzed collagen - is in fine powder form. Collagen powder can be used by adding to beverages or recipes. When added to liquid, the collagen powder then becomes liquid collagen, thus, you would be drinking collagen.</p>
<p class=""><span>COLLAGEN PILLS &amp; TABLETS</span></p>
<p class="">Collagen is also available in the form of pills, capsules, and tablets. The main difference between this form and collagen powder is that you need to take more servings in order to get an adequate amount since pills, capsules, and tablets are smaller in size compared to a scoop of collagen powder. For instance, one collagen pill usually contains 1 gram of collagen, while, the <em>minimum </em>suggested serving size of collagen to get its benefits can range anywhere from 5-10 grams, per day. That said, you would have to take the pill up to 5 times per day, minimum.</p>
<p class=""><span>LIQUID COLLAGEN</span></p>
<p class="">Liquid collagen is essentially a ready-to-drink beverage that contains collagen peptides and usually comes in a 2-16 oz bottle. </p>
<p class=""><span>COLLAGEN GUMMIES</span></p>
<p class="">Collagen gummies are usually made of gelatin - if you’re wondering what gelatin is, we’ll cover that shortly. Collagen gummies typically contain 1 gram of collagen, similarly to pills or tablets. This is due to the small size of gummies, which, in turn, you would need to take up to 5 gummies minimum per day to obtain the benefits. Additionally, collagen gummies usually contain high fructose syrup. <br><br></p>
<h3><strong>HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE COLLAGEN?</strong></h3>
<p class="">This question really comes down to what your preference is. We decided to go with <a href="https://www.wholydose.com/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collagen powder</a> because of its versatility and because it’s more easily absorbed by the body compared to capsules and pills.<br><br></p>
<h3><strong>WHAT ABOUT GELATIN? </strong></h3>
<p class="">How is <a href="https://www.academia.edu/8410348/Industrial_Gelatin_Manufacture-Theory_and_Practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gelatin</a> different than collagen peptides? Gelatin and collagen peptides have essentially the same benefits, but the main difference is its processes. Collagen peptides go through a more rigorous hydrolysis process where it is broken up into small, short chain amino acids, whereas, gelatin goes through a less rigorous process and is broken up into <a href="https://www.academia.edu/8410348/Industrial_Gelatin_Manufacture-Theory_and_Practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">longer chain amino acids</a>. </p>
<p class="">Gelatin is typically used in recipes as a thickener (such as gummies) and will only dissolve in warm and hot liquids. On the other hand, collagen peptides will dissolve in both hot and cold liquids. </p>
<h3><strong><br>ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS OF TAKING COLLAGEN?</strong></h3>
<p class="">Currently, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there are</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero</a> to minimal side effects when taking collagen. Study shows that collagen <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071580" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">may have the potential</a> to cause digestive discomfort, such as feelings of fullness. This is likely due to the body not being used to the way the amino acids in collagen are broken down in the stomach. When this does occur, the stomach needs to get used to breaking down collagen - just as with other types of food.</p>
<h3><strong><br>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN TAKING COLLAGEN</strong></h3>
<p class="">There are a few important things to know when taking collagen. </p>
<p class="">The first is, not all collagen is created equal. Collagen, just like any other ingredient, comes in various grades and from different sources. When taking collagen, it’s beneficial to know where it comes from, if it is pure (no fillers or additives), and if it is organic, non-GMO, and/or antibiotic-free. A known way to measure the quality of collagen is by adding a scoop into a glass of warm water. Pure, high-quality collagen will stay translucent - but, be mindful if you’re testing products that contain other ingredients aside from collagen only, as this may be at variance. </p>
<p class="">Now that you know the benefits of taking collagen, it’s crucial to recognize that taking collagen is not a cure-all. There are other factors that coincide with the benefits. Aside from aging, other factors that decrease collagen levels and can accelerate the aging process include:</p>

<p class="">So, it’s important to take care of you and your body while on your collagen journey - otherwise, you may not be getting all the benefits. </p>
<p class="">It’s also pivotal to understand that results differ from person to person, largely due to the fact that everyone has different genetics. </p>
<p class="">Take for example, a person with coarse hair has thicker hair follicles, whereas, a person with fine hair has thinner hair follicles. Turns out, the person with fine hair is more likely prone to hair breakage, simply, due to the density of hair follicles. Study shows that approximately <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29193553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of women</a> experience excessive hair shedding during styling. With that in mind while taking collagen - and any other supplement - results in hair will vary <a href="https://nyulangone.org/conditions/hair-loss/types" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depending on genes</a> and personal care. </p>
<p class="">Take another example, skin. We all have a different skin type - oily, dry, or combination. Each person’s skin type is the reason behind his or her pore size and appearance of skin. For instance, someone with a normal skin type has smaller pores, is less prone to acne, and might have better skin texture compared to someone with oily or dry skin. In terms of noticing the benefits of taking collagen, the person with a normal skin type might appear to have better results compared to the person with an oily or dry skin type due to the look of their skin. However, the size of our pores isn’t as important as the <em>health</em> of our pores. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26918966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other factors</a> that may contribute to the appearance of skin are the elasticity of pores, hair follicle volume, and excessive sebum (oil production), which, all trace back to our genetics and skin type.</p>
<p class="">Previously mentioned, results will vary based on the individual. As we like to put it: don’t compare your results with those of others, but rather, with your own improvements. You can only be the best version of yourself. </p>
